                            I'm currently a freshman at Virginia Tech and going for a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Professional and Technical Writing. While I’m relatively new to coding and computer science, I've mostly been doing work with Java and Python. I love learning more about coding and the full extent of what I can create with it. <br><br> Contact Information:

                                    I wrote code to display the Towers of Hanoi puzzle game with back-end code such that it would automatically solve itself. It focuses around recursion and is built using a linked stack data structure.

                                    I created and implemented code to parse and record a text file of songs and playlists with given genre values. Then, it organizes those songs into the playlist that best matches its genre value. It is built using a circular array data structure.

                                    Using HTML and CSS, I wrote the code needed to create a webpage with a short "About Me" and "Projects" section to showcase the projects I’ve worked on.
